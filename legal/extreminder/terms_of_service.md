# Terms of Service for ExtReminder

**Last Updated: November 2, 2025**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using ExtReminder (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 2. Description of Service

ExtReminder helps you create, manage, and schedule reminders and notifications on your device. The App stores reminder data locally and does not require user accounts.

## 3. User Responsibilities

- Provide accurate reminder details (times, notes, recurrence) and verify device time/timezone.
- Ensure required permissions (notifications and, optionally, exact alarms) are granted for timely delivery.
- Keep your device powered, unlocked when needed, and not restricted by aggressive power‑saving settings that prevent background execution.
- Do not rely on the App for life‑critical or safety‑critical use cases (e.g., medical emergencies, hazardous environments).

## 4. Permissions, Notifications, and Exact Alarms

- The App may request permission to send notifications and may request special access to schedule exact alarms for precise delivery.
- You can grant or revoke exact alarm access in system settings (Special app access > Alarms & reminders). Without it, delivery times may be approximate due to system optimizations.
- The App uses these permissions solely to deliver your reminders and does not use them for background tracking.

## 5. In‑App Purchases

- Purchases are processed by Google Play. We do not store payment card information.
- Entitlements are unlocked upon successful purchase. Refunds and billing issues are handled under Google Play’s policies and processes.

## 6. Advertising

- The App may display advertisements via third‑party providers (e.g., Google AdMob). Ad delivery may use device identifiers and basic device information as governed by the provider’s policies.
- Where applicable, you may opt out of personalized ads through your device settings.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights in the App and its content are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by applicable laws. You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or distribute the App except as permitted by law.

## 8. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the App to: (a) violate laws or third‑party rights; (b) transmit malware; (c) attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems; (d) interfere with service operation; or (e) circumvent technical protections.

## 9. Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR‑FREE OPERATION OR THAT REMINDERS WILL ALWAYS BE DELIVERED AT THE EXACT SPECIFIED TIME.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM.

## 11. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.

## 12. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms occasionally. The updated Terms will be posted with the revised "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 13. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of your country or state of residence to the extent permitted by mandatory law and conflict‑of‑laws principles.

## 14. Contact Us

For questions about these Terms, please contact us via the same developer email and website listed on the ExtReminder Google Play page under "Developer contact".
